Stellaris has changed quite dramatically in version 2.0, including a complete overhaul of the way FTL travel works. Overall, you can expect the pace of expansion to be more measured and deliberate, and you now have much greater choice over which star systems you want to control.

You will need to use your construction ships to build Starbases that control systems and defend your borders. Starbases can be upgraded with shipyards to construct military fleets, or turned into mighty fortresses able to defend vital choke points and strategically important systems.

Admirals have grown in importance as well, as you now have a limit on how many ships you can have in a single fleet. In place of one massive armada, in 2.0 it will be key to ensure multiple fleets are positioned correctly so they can respond to any threat to your borders - whether be it from the new, more aggressive pirates, or hostile space empires.

The war system has changed as well: you now need to make claims on an enemy's territory before declaring war on them. This means it is now possible to wage a limited war for a single system without having to fight a long, attritional struggle for it.

Larger conflicts have changed as well, with the arrival of the Colossus in the Apocalypse expansion. The Colossus is a planet-killer super-weapon that can be equipped with various armaments, one of which is capable of shattering a planet entirely.

We hope you are ready for the Apocalypse!
